# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here.

## 0.1.0 - Unreleased

### Added

- TypeScript and JavaScript AST scanning with source evidence.
- Next.js and Express/Hono route detection.
- Function-call, internal API, database, external SDK, and variable-result data-flow extraction.
- Evidence-backed Raw Code Graph and Logic Graph schemas.
- Heuristic Logic Compiler with confidence and compression diagnostics.
- React Flow and ELK interactive viewer with search, minimap, and evidence panel.
- `serve` and `analyze` CLI modes.
- Local HTTP server with restrictive file serving and security headers.
- Monorepo build, tests, package validation, and CI.

### Fixed

- Confidence is calibrated per signal instead of reporting a flat `0.86` for every
  classification, so the score in the evidence panel now distinguishes a naming
  convention from a directory convention from a verb appearing inside a name.
- Private and protected class members are no longer classified as services, which
  kept helpers such as `cap` and `audit` off the map.
- Directory conventions no longer promote code under `scripts/`, `examples/`, or
  `fixtures/`, so smoke scripts under an `agents/` tree stop appearing as agents.
- Test files (`*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `__tests__/`, `__mocks__/`) and `.d.ts`
  declarations are excluded from analysis.
- A declaration named exactly `service`, `agent`, `tool`, or `action` names its
  category rather than its behaviour and is no longer classified as one.
- The Logic Compiler skips utility-named candidates (`log`, `parse`, `isRecord`, …)
  that crowded out the flows that explain how the system runs.
